          <br></br> I’m a Creative Developer driven by a passion for turning
          innovative ideas into reality. I believe in coding as an art – where
          creativity and logic comes together to craft masterpieces that make a
          real difference. As a lifelong learner in the field of Information
          Technology, I find great excitement in technology and am consistently
          amazed by its transformative impact on the world.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I have been into this field since 2020, and throughout my
          academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various
          concepts like Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and
          Algorithms (C++), Database Management (SQL), Project Management, Web
          Technologies and more. I’ve Spent more than 262800 minutes diving into
          the Core concepts of Software engineering from requirement analysis to
          deploying products. My passion for being web engineer ignited during
          last year of my bachelor’s era when I developed a comprehensive Web
          based Education System “StudySphere”, which was developed to fill the
          gaps in existing systems. 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          After graduating in 2024 (with a gold
          medal!), I’ve been deepening my expertise by working on real-world
          projects. I’m now expanding my skill set by learning the whole MERN
          stack to enhance my ability to build fully integrated, end-to-end web
          applications with JavaScript across both the client and server sides.
          Moreover, I’m a firm believer in the Agile methodology and support its
          iterative, collaborative approach. Despite any skill gaps, my
          determination to learn compensates for them.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>Beyond the world of technology, I am an avid tea buff and
          find myself drawn to the captivating world of Graphic Arts. In my free
          time, I like to color this world from my pallet and do web surfing,
          collecting books and writing notes and yes! exploring ideas to
          developer later.
