          Console.log("Hello World! With a Dream to Serve in the World of
          Innovation"); Wanna know my Vision? I am so hell interested in being
          an ‚úßArtist‚úß. Artist??? Ain't You a Programmer?? I mean What's with ART
          when you do just coding? Just Coding??? Just??? *Sigh* Introducing
          myself as a ‚úß:ÔΩ•‚òΩÔΩ°‚úß Potato ‚úß:ÔΩ•.‚òΩÔΩ•Ôæü‚úß. Ops I am a Programmer, Precisely a
          baby Programmer. Àñ‚Å∫‚Äß‚ÇäÀö‚ú¶ I just started coding. (It's been 2 years
          practically, aah! and I have been in this field since 2020 aka 100
          years ago) As a learner (ahem fighter üí™üèª) in Information Technology, I
          said INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY... what a flex :), I find great excitement
          in technology and am consistently amazed by its transformative impact
          on the world. Certain skills I have learned in my Academia include
          Data Structures and Algorithms (Cpp), C sharp, Database management,
          and more. Spent more than 525960 minutes diving into the Core of
          Software engineering (don‚Äôt ask about the seconds). In my final year,
          I built a comprehensive Educational System for my project. That‚Äôs
          where my love story with Web Engineering began. Fast forward to
          mid-2024: I graduated (with the Gold medal! ü•ácheers ), but the
          learning never stopped! Currently, I am learning Web specifically
          practicing LARAVEL for the backend due to its dynamic and versatile
          nature and database management in SQL. I have done various projects to
          get hands-on experience. Sideways, I practice REACT for chemical
          reactions. Ops, I mean for Front END, THE END, hehe. No!, not THE END,
          I am still practicing React. Can you see my open IDE? Although I‚Äôm
          still a baby Potato, I‚Äôm aiming to become a giant Ghost (like Casper,
          but with cooler code). Sure, there are skill gaps, but my
          determination fills them faster than a web page with lazy loading.
          Beyond the world of technology, I am an avid tea buff and find myself
          drawn to the captivating world of Graphic Arts. In my free time, I
          like to color this world from my pallet and do web surfing, collecting
          books and writing notes, and yeah saving ideas to develop later
          [Later]. /* Updating my Skill-set every day, one byte at a time */
          SKILLS summary (will update soon) ‚Ä¢ Programming: C++ | PHP ‚Ä¢

          Structures | Software Engineering Let‚Äôs rewind to my vision: I want to
          be a Web Engineer. [Big term, huh? Wish me luck!] Fun Fact: I
          loveeeeeeeeeeee practicing Data Structures and algorithms and, of
          course, ‚ú¶REACT‚ú¶ :))) Alright, time to get back to work. Have a good
          day!
